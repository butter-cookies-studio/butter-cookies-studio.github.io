This privacy policy is applicable to the **Mooni** app (hereinafter referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, which was developed by **Butter Cookies** (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is provided "AS IS".

### What information does the Application obtain?

**User Provided Information**  
The Application does not require any user registration or account creation. We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number. Any data you enter (e.g., cycle logs, notes) is stored locally on your device using SQLite and is not transmitted to our servers.

**Automatically Collected Information**  
The Application may collect certain information automatically to ensure the app functions correctly and to provide advertisements via AdMob. This includes:

- The type of mobile device you use
- Your device's unique device ID (AD ID)
- The IP address of your mobile device
- Your mobile operating system
- Information about the way you use the Application

### Location & AI Information

- **Location:** This Application does not gather precise, real-time information about the location of your mobile device.
- **AI:** The Application does not use Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to process your personal data.

### Third-Party Access

Only aggregated, anonymized data is transmitted to external services to help us improve the Application. We utilize the following third-party services:

- **Google Play Services:** [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- **AdMob:** [Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en)

### Data Retention & Management

Since all your cycle data is stored locally on your device, we do not retain your personal data on our servers. You can delete all your data at any time by clearing the app cache or uninstalling the Application.

### Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal data, parents can rest assured that their child's information is not being stored or shared.

### Security

We care about the security of your information. Since your data is stored locally, it is protected by your device's own security features (like PIN or Biometrics). We also provide an App Lock feature for extra privacy.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
